Overview
This project aims to create a robust data pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for collecting and processing flight data using Pub/Sub, Dataflow, BigQuery, and Cloud Storage. The pipeline will extract flight information from a Pub/Sub topic, transform the data using Dataflow, and load it into BigQuery and Cloud Storage for analysis and storage.
